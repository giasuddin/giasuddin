The functionality offered by an API is not always accessed uniformly throughout the lifetime of a client program. We propose Temporal API Usage Pattern Mining to detect API usage patterns in terms of their time of introduction into client programs. We detect concepts as distinct groups of API functionality from the change history of a client program. We locate those concepts in the client change history and detect temporal usage patterns, where a pattern contains a set of concepts that were added into the client program in a specific temporal order. We investigated the properties of temporal API usage patterns through a multiple-case study of three APIs and their use in up to 19 client software projects. Our technique was able to detect a number of valuable patterns in two out of three of the APIs investigated. Further investigation showed some patterns to be relatively consistent between clients, produced by multiple developers, and not trivially derivable from program structure or API documentation.","tags":["ICSE","API","Documentation"],"title":"Temporal Analysis of API Usage Concepts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Gias Uddin**","Barthélémy Dagenais","Martin P.

A service-based system is usually dynamic due to mutual collaboration among stakeholders to achieve goals, perform tasks and manage resources. However, it lacks the presence of a central authority to monitor the trustworthiness of service users. In this chapter, we propose a trust monitoring architecture, called TrAM (Trust Architecture for Monitoring) to monitor the trustworthiness of service users at run-time, facilitating the analysis of interactions from trust perspectives. Monitoring allows the enforcement of corrective actions that may protect the software by mitigating major unwanted incidents. The performance of the architecture has been evaluated by monitoring a prototype file-sharing grid.","tags":["HASC","Software Security"],"title":"A Trust Monitoring Architecture for Service-Based Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Gias Uddin**","Mohammad Zulkernine","Sheikh Iqbal Ahamed"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1256860800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1256860800,"objectID":"8e60890ff00762a3d3c896f3a216080c","permalink":"https://giasuddin.github.io/publication/collaboration-trust-model-soca2009/","publishdate":"2009-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/collaboration-trust-model-soca2009/","section":"publication","summary":"The open and dynamic nature of service-based software systems necessitates spontaneous and trustworthy interactions between collaborating entities. Service providers are exposed to users spanned across multiple organizational domains, so can be exploited by potentially untrustworthy service requestors. Given that, service providers need to trust requestors before granting them with services. Trust encompasses a number of quality attributes (e.g., security, competence, honesty) and helps in dynamic decision making. In this paper, we present a trust-based service collaboration approach, facilitated by the analysis of service-based interactions between service providers and requestors, and recommendations between service providers. Service providers exchange recommendations to convey their trust on requestors. This collaboration is quantified using our proposed trust model, called CAT, a Context-Aware Trust model based on service-based interactions by considering services as contexts. We identify a number of collaboration-based trust properties including risk and context-awareness and incorporate them in CAT. A context-similarity parameter is introduced to decide on similar services. A time-based ageing parameter is proposed to decrease trust values over time without any further interactions. Direct and indirect recommendations from other service providers are included in total trust calculation, with a path-based ageing parameter applying over indirect recommendations. A mechanism to calculate the accuracy of recommendations is proposed to differentiate between reliable and unreliable recommendations. These calculation schemes are employed in a trust-based service collaboration algorithm to automatically decide on granting services to requestors. The approach is elaborated using examples from file sharing applications, and successfully evaluated by implementing a prototype service-based file sharing grid.","tags":["SOCA","Software Security"],"title":"Collaboration through computation: incorporating trust model into service-based software systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chanchal Kumar Roy","**Gias Uddin**","Banani Roy","Thomas R.
