abstract = "We study empirically the impact of sentiment embodied within developersâ€™ comments on the time and outcome of the code review process. We found that (1) contributors frequently express positive and negative sentiments during code review activities; (2) the expressed sentiments differ among the contributors depending on their position within the social network of the reviewers ( e.g., core vs peripheral contributors); (3) the sentiments expressed by contributors tend to be neutral as they progress from the status of newcomer in an OSS project to the status of core team contributors; (4) the reviews with negative comments on average took more time to complete than the reviews with positive/neutral comments, and (5) the reviews with controversial comments took significantly longer time in one project."
