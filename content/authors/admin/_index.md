I am a Senior Data scientist at the Data and Statistics Office of [Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/). The views expressed on this website are mine, no responsibility for those should be attributed to the Bank of Canada.

Prior to Bank of Canada, I worked at [Apption](http://www.apption.com/) as a Data Scientist and at [IBM Canada](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/), both as a researcher and as a software engineer. At IBM, I was part of the [IBM Watson Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/watson-analytics) team, where I developed techniques to improve the natural language query understanding process in the Watson Analytics engine. Before IBM, I also worked for more than two years at [Recognia, Inc.](https://www.recognia.com/)

I have completed my PhD from the School of Computer Science of [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). My research interests include empirical software engineering, with a focus on big data. Specifically, I leverage Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques on the vast amount data available in online software repositories. As part of my PhD research, I have the created Opiner, an online opinion search and summarization engine for APIs. Check out Opiner at: http://opiner.polymtl.ca
